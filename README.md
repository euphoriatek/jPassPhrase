================

Formerly JRPassphrase by Roger Noar
JRPassphrase makes it easy to control registration on your Joomla website by requiring that a passphrase be correctly entered before someone can register - useful for your existing club, organization, church, schools, etc. It is also great at keeping the 'bots' from creating phony user registrations on your site. JRPassphrase consists of a plugin and a module â€“ you will need to install both. The plugin intercepts the URL of the registration page, so that a passphrase must be properly submitted before a user can register on the site. You can distribute the passphrase to your members via newsletter, email, etc. The passphrase can also be the answer to a question that your members already know - such as: "What is your coach's nickname?", etc.
